## University of Denver System Cybersecurity Administration Portfolio

This repository content reflects system cybersecurity lessons and work I completed related to Azure network, Ansible, and Linux systems administration during University of Denver's 24-week Cybersecurity Bootcamp certificate program. Details on the program are available at https://bootcamp.du.edu/cybersecurity/.

Sections include:

- Ansible: An overview of an Azure-platformed network with Linux virtual machines configured and managed via Ansible and Docker containers.
- Linux: A collection of assignments and scripts demonstrating the application of various system administration and data management concepts.
- Diagrams: A repository of technical diagrams I created to further explain different elements of my work within the program.
- Penetration Testing: A presentation documenting a penetration test against an Apache web server on an Azure network.
