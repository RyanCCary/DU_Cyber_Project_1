## University of Denver Cybersecurity Diagrams

The content in this repository reflects lessons and work I completed during University of Denver's 24-week Cybersecurity Bootcamp certificate program. Details on the program are available at https://bootcamp.du.edu/cybersecurity/.

Sections include:

- Ansible: An overview of an Azure-platformed network with Linux virtual machines configured and managed with Ansible via Docker containers.
- Linux: A collection of assignments and scripts demonstrating the application of varied scripting and system administration concepts.
- Diagrams: A repository of technical diagrams I created to further explain different elements of my work within the program.
